## 🧠 Project Overview

_“No Surprises”_ here — this project explores the evolution of music genres, subgenres, and audio features over the decades using data collected from multiple sources, including the **Spotify Web API** and the **Last.fm API**. Since Spotify’s genre data was limited (surprise surprise...), we leveraged Last.fm to fill in missing genre and subgenre classifications — making our dataset richer, cleaner, and more representative.

To orchestrate our workflow and ensure everything stayed _“In Its Right Place”_, we built a data pipeline using **Apache Airflow** and stored our processed data in **PostgreSQL**.

Our project is based on Billboard’s **Top 200 Albums of All Time**, providing a solid foundation for trend analysis across decades.
