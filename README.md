## 🧠 Project Overview

This project explores the evolution of music genres, subgenres, and audio features over the decades using data collected from multiple sources, including the **Spotify Web API** and the **Last.fm API**. Since Spotify’s genre data was limited (no surprises), we leveraged Last.fm to fill in missing genre and subgenre classifications making our dataset richer, cleaner, and more representative.

To orchestrate our workflow, we built a data pipeline using **Apache Airflow** and stored our processed data in **PostgreSQL**.

Our project is based on Billboard’s **Top 200 Albums of All Time**, providing a solid foundation for trend analysis across decades.
